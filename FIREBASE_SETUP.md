flutter pub get
```

## Step 7: Test the Authentication

1. Run your app: `flutter run`
2. You should see the login screen
3. Try creating a new account
4. Test logging in and out

## Security Rules for Firestore

Update your Firestore security rules to allow authenticated users to read/write their own data:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Users can only read/write their own training sessions
    match /users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Features Included

The authentication system includes:

- ‚úÖ Email/Password registration and login
- ‚úÖ Password strength validation
- ‚úÖ Password reset functionality
- ‚úÖ User profile creation in Firestore
- ‚úÖ Secure sign out
- ‚úÖ Authentication state management
- ‚úÖ Beautiful dark theme UI
- ‚úÖ Form validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Loading states and animations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"google-services.json not found"**
   - Make sure you've downloaded and placed the file in `android/app/google-services.json`
   - Verify the package name matches your `build.gradle` file

2. **"Firebase not initialized"**
   - Ensure you've added the Firebase dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`
   - Check that `Firebase.initializeApp()` is called in `main.dart`

3. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Verify that Email/Password authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
   - Check that your app is properly configured with the correct package name

4. **"Permission denied"**
   - Update your Firestore security rules to allow authenticated access
   - Ensure users are properly authenticated before accessing data

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
2. Review the [Flutter Firebase plugin documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/)
3. Check the console logs for detailed error messages
4. Verify your Firebase project configuration

## Next Steps

After setting up authentication, you can:

1. Add more authentication providers (Google, Apple, etc.)
2. Implement user profile management
3. Add data persistence for training sessions
4. Set up push notifications
5. Add analytics and crash reporting

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive keys to version control**
   - Add `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

2. **Implement proper security rules**
   - Always validate user permissions in Firestore rules
   - Use Firebase Auth to verify user identity

3. **Handle errors gracefully**
   - Provide clear error messages to users
   - Log errors for debugging (but not sensitive data)

4. **Regular security updates**
   - Keep Firebase SDKs updated
   - Monitor Firebase Console for security alerts
